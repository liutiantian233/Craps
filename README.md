# Craps - A popular dice game

**A popular dice game is Craps.** In this project you will handle the rolling of dice and wagers while a user plays the game. Wagering for craps is complicated; we use a simplified version here.

**The rules** A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins (this is called a “Natural win”). If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw (called "craps"), the player loses (i.e. the "house" wins). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, then the sum becomes the player's "point." To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your point." The player loses by rolling a 7 before making the point.
